This code is part of a personal project to remotely control a KitchenAid Oven using a Google Assistant and a Raspberry Pi.  

The source is used with the particle.io Web IDE and is intended for the Raspberry Pi particle-agent.

IFTTT is used to allow for custom Google Assistant commands and broadcasts Particle events. This project subscribes to those events and executes routines based on the event received.
